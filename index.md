# The Good Labs

 > for the greater good

Transparency, including [open communication](https://github.com/pdurbin/slopi-communication), incentives, and funding are essential
components to create a healthy environment for software development. The Good Labs
is an initiative to promote these ideas, and support open source projects that
are transparently for the greater good. We provide:

 - *an affirmation*: to assert that a community is for the greater good
 - *community*: of open source developers that believe in transparency
 - *tools*: to support transparency and communication in these communities
