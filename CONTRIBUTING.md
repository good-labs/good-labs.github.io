## How to add members to a team

Before maintainers of projects can add members to teams the members must be added to the good-labs organization by one of the owners of the organization. You can see a list of owners at https://github.com/orgs/good-labs/people?query=role%3Aowner and then click on their usernames to find contact information for them. Ask them to add the future team member to the organization.
