# The Good Labs

Before you are ready to contribute, make sure that you understand the goals of The Good Labs.
If you have any questions, please [open an issue](https://www.github.com/good-labs/org/issues).

## How do I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute! Here are a few examples.

### 1. Take the Pledge

If you or your organization can assert that your software is for the greater good,
we invite you to [take the pledge](https://www.github.com/good-labs/greater-good-pledge). Taking the pledge will generate a badge that
you can share on your community and projects pages as an assertion that you are for
the greater good.

### 2. Join the Community

If you want to join the community, there are many ways to do this!

 - [Join on GitHub](https://www.github.com/good-labs/org) by opening an issue and requesting membership.

We will have other channels of communication added shortly.

### 3. Contribute a Project

If you have an idea for a project that fits well with the organization goals, we invite you
to submit a proposal under the [good-labs/org](https://www.github.com/good-labs/org) repository.
Generally, your proposal should summarize the problem that the project aims to address, the project
itself, and plans for implementation.
