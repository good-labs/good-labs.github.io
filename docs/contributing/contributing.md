# The Good Labs

Before you are ready to contribute, make sure that you understand the goals of The Good Labs.
If you have any questions, please [open an issue](https://www.github.com/good-labs/good-labs.github.io/issues).

## How do I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute! Here are a few examples.

### 1. Take the Pledge

If you or your organization can assert that your software is for the greater good,
we invite you to [take the pledge](https://www.github.com/good-labs/greater-good-affirmation). Taking the pledge will generate a badge that
you can share on your community and projects pages as an assertion that you are for
the greater good.

### 2. Join the Community

If you want to join the community, there are many ways to do this!

 - [Join on GitHub](https://www.github.com/good-labs/good-lab.github.io/) by opening an issue and requesting membership.
 - [Mailing List](https://murmur.csail.mit.edu/groups/good-labs) is used sparsely to ask questions or share fun projects.
 - [Gitter](https://gitter.im/good-labs/community) to join active conversation, or ask a question!

### 3. Contribute a Project

If you have an idea for a project that fits well with the organization goals, we invite you
to submit a proposal under the [proposals folder](https://www.github.com/good-labs/good-labs.github.io/tree/master/docs/projects) folder.
in this repository. Generally, your proposal should summarize the problem that the project aims to address, the project
itself, and plans for implementation. If you'd prefer to start by bouncing some ideas off the community before submitting a proposal, please feel free to do so in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/good-labs/community) or the [mailing list](https://murmur.csail.mit.edu/groups/good-labs).
