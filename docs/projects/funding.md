## What is it?

The [Transparent Funding](https://www.github.com/good-labs/FUNDING.md) project aims
to encourage projects and communities to disclose funding sources and how the
support is used. An undocumented GitHub feature, the "FUNDING.yml" file can help
to provide a programmatic link to a place to contribute, while a more verbose FUNDING.md
can describe community protocol for accepting donations, and disclose funding sources
and how the support is used toward the project.

## Why do we need it?

If a project is valuable to me, I should be able to easily find how to financially support it.
If I contribute to a project financially or by way of giving my time, I should also
have transparency about how my contribution is being invested or used. Having shared
goals and/or values is an important detail for a contributor to share with a community
that is often assumed and not directly stated.

## Project Plan

The community is encouraged to add links to example funding files, along with
suggesting entirely new methods or file types to accomplish the same goal. 
Any suggestions, questions, or ideas in spirit of this initiative are invited
to [open a pull request or issue](https://www.github.com/good-labs/FUNDING.md)
on the project repository.
