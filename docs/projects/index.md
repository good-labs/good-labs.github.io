## The Greater Good Affirmation

The Greater Good Affirmation is an assertion a community or project can make to be for the greater good. Read more about [the pledge]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/projects/greater-good) or take the [the affirmation here](https://good-labs.github.io/greater-good-affirmation/).


## The Human Menu

There are huge detriments to our society and mental health as a result of the [attention economy](https://humanetech.com/problem/). Instead
of typical selection from a set of YouTube videos or social media apps, the Human Menu aims to provide a list of choices that exist
but are sometimes forgotten. Read more about [the project here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/projects/human-menu/).


## Searchable Linkable Open Public Indexed (SLOPI) Communication

The Searchable Linkable Open Public Indexed (SLOPI) Communication project is an effort to remind open source developers of the importance of transparent communication rather than favoring Slack for discussion and decision making. Read more about [the project here](https://github.com/pdurbin/slopi-communication).
