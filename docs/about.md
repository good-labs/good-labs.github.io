## About Good Labs

The Good Labs purpose can be summarized in a simple phrase:

> for the greater good

We aim to provide support for transparency of open source communities. This means that
we value:

 - open communication
 - clear incentives
 - disclosure of funding or conflicts on interest

and take initiative to help communities to make this information easily accessible.
With this kind of transparency, we can foster a healthy environment for software development. 

### How do I participate?

We invite interested communities to sign the 
[profit free pledge](https://www.github.com/good-labs/profit-free-plege) to
assert that one or more of their projects are for the greater good. We encourage
this process is done with a quick pull request, however if you would like make
a quick suggestion, you can use [this Google form](https://forms.gle/xkG4CvwhJEzThCjN7).

### Where can I learn more?

In addition to this documentation base, you can find proposals and web resources (podcasts, articles, and other media) to support
your own learning at [good-labs/org](https://www.github.com/good-labs/org/)

### Challenges

Open source, along with culture that develops around it, is a living, and changing thing. It's important that we don't make value statements about
the sub-cultures that develop, but rather encourage transparency in these sub-cultures. If a user chooses to participate in an open source project,
all of this information should be available to him or her. If you would like to [to contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute) your issues, thoughts, 
and questions, we encourage and welcome your participation.

> Where do I go from here?

We suggest that you start with learning about our projects.
